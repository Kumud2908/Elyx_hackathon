02/04/24, 07:32 - Rohan: Travelling to Jakarta next week—hotel gym is tiny.
02/04/24, 07:33 - Rachel (PT): I’ll swap one resistance day for bodyweight circuits. Updated in app.
03/04/24, 10:15 - Rohan: My Garmin says my deep sleep average is 55 min. Is that bad?
03/04/24, 10:17 - Advik (Performance Scientist): Below optimal. We’ll test earlier dinner + no screen last 45 min before bed. Track for 2 weeks.
05/04/24, 14:50 - Rohan: Sarah says I have a breakfast meeting at 8 AM on a fasting blood draw day. Problem?
05/04/24, 14:52 - Ruby (Concierge): We can shift the draw to 7 AM and you can still make the meeting. Confirm?
05/04/24, 14:53 - Rohan: Confirm.

03/05/24, 18:00 - Ruby (Concierge): Weekly Report - Week 5: Resting HR: 65 bpm (down 2), avg glucose: 105 mg/dL, step count avg: 7,200/day. Notable improvement in morning alertness per your self-report. Continue meditation trial, maintain morning mobility routine.

05/05/24, 07:20 - Rohan: Read about berberine as “natural metformin.” Thoughts?
05/05/24, 07:23 - Carla (Nutritionist): Evidence is mixed. We can discuss after next labs. It may cause GI issues, so not a first-line supplement unless needed.
08/05/24, 11:15 - Rohan: Need low-sugar snacks for 12-hr flight to JFK.
08/05/24, 11:16 - Ruby (Concierge): Suggest: roasted almonds, cheese sticks, turkey jerky, or small dark chocolate (85%). Will have Sarah stock before departure.
09/05/24, 15:10 - Rohan: Missed morning workout today.

07/06/24, 14:05 - Rohan: LDL not improving—why?
07/06/24, 14:07 - Dr. Warren (Medical Strategist): Likely due to dietary saturated fat from travel meals. Carla will adjust plan with more soluble fiber & plant sterols.
07/06/24, 14:10 - Carla (Nutritionist): Adding oat bran at breakfast, chia pudding, and sterol-fortified snacks. Trial for 8 weeks.

08/08/24, 08:12 - Carla (Nutritionist): Excellent—keep it up during travel weeks too. Will note in plan as a “travel hack.”
11/08/24, 11:05 - Rohan: Next week’s Jakarta trip—hotel gym closed.
11/08/24, 11:06 - Rachel (PT): Sending no-equipment 15-min HIIT plan + stretching routine.
15/08/24, 14:30 - Rohan: What’s the difference between LDL particle size and LDL-C?
15/08/24, 14:34 - Dr. Warren (Medical Strategist): LDL-C is total cholesterol content; particle size matters because small, dense particles are more atherogenic. Advanced lipid panel in Month 6 will check this.

02/10/24, 07:05 - Rohan: Given my numbers are good now, do I really need to avoid all white rice?
02/10/24, 07:08 - Carla (Nutritionist): We can reintroduce small portions (½ cup) with lunch 2x/week and monitor glucose response.
05/10/24, 09:15 - Rohan: Read about time-restricted eating helping longevity. Worth it?
05/10/24, 09:17 - Dr. Warren (Medical Strategist): Evidence promising, but not conclusive. If you try, stick to 10–12 hr eating window; no need for extreme fasting.
06/10/24, 18:00 - Ruby (Concierge): Weekly Report - Week 25: Compliance: 70% this week (2 missed workouts due to travel). Glucose stable, 1 small spike from buffet breakfast in Bangkok. Recommendation: keep portion sizes controlled at hotel buffets.

18/10/24, 15:32 - Rachel (PT): Sent to app—3 circuits, ~20 min, no equipment needed.
20/10/24, 17:55 - Advik (Performance Scientist): Weekly Report - Week 27: HRV: 44 ms (personal best), deep sleep avg: 1h 35m, glucose stable all week. Suggest maintaining current structure and not adding more training load this month.

04/11/24, 07:15 - Rachel (PT): New 2-week workout plan uploaded—keeping 2 strength, 2 cardio, 1 swim session.
04/11/24, 07:17 - Rohan: Good. I’ll be in Singapore 3 weeks straight—let’s keep intensity high.
04/11/24, 07:18 - Rachel (PT): Added one extra cardio day per week.
06/11/24, 09:20 - Rohan: My resting HR is now 60 bpm. Is there such a thing as too low?
06/11/24, 09:22 - Advik (Performance Scientist): Under 50 without symptoms could be concerning, but 60 is excellent for cardiovascular health.
10/11/24, 18:00 - Ruby (Concierge): Weekly Report - Week 29: Compliance: 85% this week, highest yet. HRV avg: 45 ms, deep sleep: 1h 40m avg, glucose variability minimal. Continue current setup.
